# @drovp/font-generator

Generates fonts with optional subsetting.

## Note

Uses [fonteditor-core](https://github.com/kekee000/fonteditor-core) library under the hood, which has a pretty bad documentation, and not that many features. So, if you see the library being misused, or have an idea how to do things better, or maybe know about a better font processing library, [create na issue](https://github.com/drovp/font-generator/issues)!.
